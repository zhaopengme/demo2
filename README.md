## Getting Started

You can either click `Use this template` button on this repository and clone the repo or directly from your terminal execute [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with npm or Yarn or pnpm to bootstrap a new project with this starter:

```
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/shivapoudel/nextjs-starter with-nextjs-starter
# or
yarn create next-app -e https://github.com/shivapoudel/nextjs-starter with-nextjs-starter
# or
pnpm create next-app -- --e https://github.com/shivapoudel/nextjs-starter with-nextjs-starter
```

Once the project and dependencies are finished installing, you can navigate to that directory and start up the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Available CLI commands

- `yarn build` - Creates an optimized production build of your application.
- `yarn start` - Starts the application in production mode.
